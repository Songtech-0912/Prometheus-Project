# Prometheus Project

 Bringing Linux applications to every Linux distribution.

## About the Project

The goal of this project is to make Linux more accessible by creating *appimages* of as many apps as possible. An `appimage` is a universal linux packaging format that reduces the need for each distro to have a separate package. Appimages are fast, convienient, and secure. 

However, less well known Linux apps often don't have the luxury of being packaged as appimages, and because of this, they only run on a few platforms, or have to be built from source, which discourages many users. If these apps could be packaged as appimages, they would be more accessible, and they might gain more exposure and become more well-known. That is exactly what this project aims to do.

## Getting Started

### 1. Learn how to make an AppImage

Information on packaging appimages is available in the [docs](./docs/Introduction.md). 

### 2. Try out an AppImage

The list of AppImages is constantly growing. Currently, I've packaged these apps as appimages:

* Blender

    * Blender 2.83: get it [here](https://github.com/Songtech-0912/Prometheus-Project/releases/tag/v1.0-beta)

    * Blender 2.90 (beta): get it [here](https://github.com/Songtech-0912/Prometheus-Project/releases/tag/v1.0-beta)

* Instant Meshes: get it [here](https://github.com/Songtech-0912/Prometheus-Project/releases/tag/v1.0-beta.2)

Alternatively, you may also download these appimages on [AppImageHub](https://www.appimagehub.com/). For the links to each AppImage hosted on AppImageHub, see [publish-list.md](publish-list.md).

### 3. Give feedback about AppImages

Any feedback about how well the AppImages here perform would be greatly appreciated. You can open an [issue](https://github.com/Songtech-0912/Prometheus-Project/issues) or take [this survey](https://yuxuansong419407.typeform.com/to/f09PivNq)  to give feedback.

## Roadmap

I will continue making the Prometheus Project better, and that means I'm working on these things at the moment:

- A proper website for downloading the AppImages, giving feedback, etc.
- A script that will mirror these appimages to AppImageHub
- Proper docs for the Prometheus Project, with detailed instructions on how to build AppImages, troubleshooting AppImage errors, etc.
- Adding backward compatibility for AppImages
- A true 1.0 stable release instead of countless pre-releases
